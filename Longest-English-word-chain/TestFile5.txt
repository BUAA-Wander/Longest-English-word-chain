However,the mental attitude only matters when the the difference of strength is not very tremendous on the ground that if the capacity of a team is dominant,they will succeed very easily. For example,in the 2002 Korea and Japan's World soccer cup ,though the chinese male soccer team tried their best in the field and fought to the last second of every game,they couldn't even have one goal and lost all of matches in the group stage. The only reason of such terrible results is the lack of comprehensive strength rather than the problem of their mental attitude.
